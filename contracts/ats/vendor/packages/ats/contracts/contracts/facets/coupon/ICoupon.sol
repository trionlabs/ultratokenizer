 * @dev Inherits `ICouponTypes` for the shared struct/enum tier (`Coupon`, `RegisteredCoupon`,
 *      `CouponFor`, `CouponAmountFor`, `RateCalculationStatus`). Domain events and errors live
 *      on this writer interface (not on the shared types tier) so that read-only sibling
 *      facets such as `ICouponSecurityHolders` and `ICouponListing` do not pick up symbols
 *      they never emit or revert with — a narrow EIP-165 interfaceId is the goal. Aggregated
 *      into the off-chain `IAsset` umbrella alongside the read-only sibling facets.
