/**
 * @title IControlList
 * @author Asset Tokenization Studio Team
 * @notice Interface for managing the on-chain control list of a security token. The control list
 *         operates in one of two modes set at initialisation: whitelist (only listed addresses may
 *         transfer) or blacklist (listed addresses are blocked from transferring).
 * @dev Part of the Diamond facet system. Control list state is stored at
 *      `STORAGE_LOCATION_CONTROL_LIST` via `ControlListStorageWrapper`. `ROLE_CONTROL_LIST` is
 *      required for all state-mutating functions after initialisation. Note that
 *      `isInControlList` reflects raw set membership only; effective access is determined by
 *      `ControlListStorageWrapper.isAbleToAccess`, which combines the membership result with the
 *      `isWhiteList` flag and external control list authorisation.
