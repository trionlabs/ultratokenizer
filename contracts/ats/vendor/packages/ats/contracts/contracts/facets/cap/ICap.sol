/**
 * @title ICap
 * @author Asset Tokenization Studio Team
 * @notice Interface for managing the maximum token supply of a security token, both globally and
 *         per partition. The cap enforces an upper bound on minting and may be updated by
 *         authorised callers provided the new cap is not below the current total supply.
 * @dev Part of the Diamond facet system. Cap state is stored at `STORAGE_LOCATION_CAP` via
 *      `CapStorageWrapper`. `ROLE_CAP` is required to update the cap after initialisation.
 *      `getMaxSupply` returns the cap adjusted for any pending scheduled balance-adjustment
 *      factor (ABAF); if the adjusted value would overflow `uint256` it saturates to
 *      `MAX_UINT256`. Partition caps are initialised once alongside the global cap and updated
 *      through separate partition-scoped functions not exposed by this interface.
