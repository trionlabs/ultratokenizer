 *         deactivated, every operation guarded by the `onlyActivated` modifier reverts with
 *         `Deactivated`, effectively retiring the token from active use.
 * @dev Part of the Diamond facet system. Deactivation state is stored via
 *      `DeactivateStorageWrapper` under a dedicated storage slot. The transition `active →
 *      deactivated` is one-way: there is no companion `reactivate` selector. `ROLE_DEACTIVATE`
 *      is required to flip the flag.
