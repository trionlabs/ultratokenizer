/**
 * @title IFreeze
 * @author Asset Tokenization Studio Team
 * @notice Interface for freezing and unfreezing token balances and wallet addresses on a security
 *         token. Partial freezes lock a specific token amount while address freezes block all
 *         token operations for the affected wallet.
 * @dev Part of the Diamond facet system. Freeze state is stored via `ERC3643StorageWrapper`.
 *      Partial token freeze/unfreeze operations are restricted to single-partition tokens.
 *      Both `ROLE_FREEZE_MANAGER` and `ROLE_AGENT` are authorised to call all mutating
 *      functions. Freezing tokens reduces the holder's liquid balance; unfreezing restores it
 *      and emits a `Transfer` event from `address(0)`.
