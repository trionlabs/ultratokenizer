 * @title ILock

 * @notice Interface for default-partition token lock operations and global (all-partition)
 *         read queries.
 * @dev Exposes the single-partition write methods (`lock`, `release`) and the global read
 *      methods. Partition-aware writes and partition-scoped reads live in
 *      `ILockByPartition`. Inherits `ILockTypes` for the `LockedByPartition` /
 *      `LockByPartitionReleased` events and the `LockExpirationNotReached` / `WrongLockId`
 *      errors that both Lock facets share. The `LockData` struct is declared here because
 *      it is the I/O of `getLockByPartition`, exposed only by `LockFacet`.
