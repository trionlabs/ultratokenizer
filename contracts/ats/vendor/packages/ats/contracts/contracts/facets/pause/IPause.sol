/**
 * @title IPause
 * @author Asset Tokenization Studio Team
 * @notice Interface for pausing and unpausing a security token. When paused, all
 *         transfer-related operations are blocked. The effective pause state is the logical OR of
 *         the token's own pause flag and the pause state of any registered external pause
 *         contracts.
 * @dev Part of the Diamond facet system. Pause state is stored via `PauseStorageWrapper`.
 *      `ROLE_PAUSER` is required for `pause` and `unpause`. `isPaused` consults both the
 *      internal flag and every external pause contract registered via
 *      `ExternalPauseManagementFacet`; any single paused source makes the whole token paused.
 *      Clearing the internal flag with `unpause` does not override active external pauses.
