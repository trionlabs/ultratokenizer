 * @title IDocumentation
 * @notice Interface for on-chain document management, enabling attachment, removal,
 *         and retrieval of off-chain documents referenced by a unique `bytes32` name.
 * @dev Implementing contracts are expected to gate write operations behind role-based
 *      access control and pause checks. Storage is managed via a dedicated diamond
 *      storage slot (`STORAGE_LOCATION_DOCUMENTATION`) to avoid layout collisions.
 *      All function selectors are identical to those of the former `IERC1643` interface,
 *      preserving full ABI compatibility.
