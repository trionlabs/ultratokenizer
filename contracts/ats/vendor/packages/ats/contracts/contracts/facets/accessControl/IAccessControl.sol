/**
 * @title IAccessControl
 * @author Asset Tokenization Studio Team
 * @notice Interface for role-based access control on a security token. Supports granting,
 *         revoking, and renouncing roles, batch application via `applyRoles`, and paginated
 *         queries for role members and account roles.
 * @dev Part of the Diamond facet system. Role state is stored via
 *      `AccessControlStorageWrapper`. Each role has an admin role; only accounts holding a
 *      role's admin role may grant or revoke it. `applyRoles` enforces this per-role in the
 *      storage layer. Role and member sets are backed by `EnumerableSet`, ensuring O(1) membership
 *      checks and deterministic pagination.
