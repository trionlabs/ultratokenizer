/**
 * @title ICorporateActions
 * @author Asset Tokenization Studio Team
 * @notice Interface for reading corporate action records stored on a security token. Corporate
 *         actions represent issuer-initiated events (e.g. dividends, votes, KPI settlements)
 *         that are registered on-chain and classified by an arbitrary `bytes32` action type.
 * @dev Part of the Diamond facet system. Corporate actions are stored at
 *      `STORAGE_LOCATION_CORPORATE_ACTION` via `CorporateActionsStorageWrapper`. Each action
 *      is assigned a 1-based sequential `bytes32` ID and de-duplicated by a content hash of
 *      `keccak256(abi.encode(actionType, data))`. Write operations (add, cancel, update) are
 *      defined in domain-specific interfaces that extend this one.
