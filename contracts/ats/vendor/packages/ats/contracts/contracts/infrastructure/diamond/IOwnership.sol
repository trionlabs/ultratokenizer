 *      follows the OpenZeppelin Ownable2Step pattern: the current owner nominates a successor
 *      via {transferOwnership}, and the nominee must call {acceptOwnership} to finalise the
 *      handover. This guards against transfers to addresses that cannot operate the
 *      configuration. Implementations are expected to gate the entrypoints behind the
 *      configuration owner / pending owner checks and the global pause switch.
