 *      its own owner and pending owner, enabling multi-tenant configurations on a single
 *      diamond. State changes are emitted via {IOwnership} events; access is enforced by the
 *      `onlyConfigurationOwner` / `onlyConfigurationPendingOwner` modifiers inherited from
 *      {OwnershipWrapper}.
