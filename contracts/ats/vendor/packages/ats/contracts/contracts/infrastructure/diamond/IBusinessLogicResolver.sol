/**
 * @title Contracts Repository
 * @notice This contract is used to register and resolve Business Logics (aka contracts) addresses using
 *          a bytes32 as key.
 *
 *			All registered Business Logics must have the same number of versions, so that they have a common "latest"
 *			version and any previous version can be resolved for any existing Business Logic no matter when it was
 *			added to the register.
 *         The idea is that consumers should use Business Logics belonging to the same version since those are
 * 		considered fully compatible.
 *			Registering a business logic (register = update its latest version or add it to the registry) will increase the
 *			latest version for all Business Logics by 1.
